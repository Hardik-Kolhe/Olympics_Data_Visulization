## Introduction

This project explores the Olympic Games from 1896 to 2022, focusing on hosting patterns, medal distribution, France's performance across sports, and the impact of hosting the Summer Olympics on the host country’s total medal count. The data used comes from a Kaggle dataset with comprehensive information about the Olympic Games, including hosting countries, medal counts, and athlete performance data.

## Research Questions

- **Hosting by Country and Continent**: What is the distribution of countries and continents hosting the Olympics from 1896 to 2022?
- **Medal Distribution**: How are total medals and individual gold, silver, and bronze medals distributed among countries in the Olympics?
- **France's Olympic Medals by Sport**: What is the distribution of medals won by France in the Olympics across different sports, represented as a percentage of total medals won?
- **Home Advantage**: Does hosting the Summer Olympics increase a host country’s total medal count compared to previous Games?

## Data Collection

- **Source**: The data for this project was sourced from a Kaggle dataset.
- **Data Size**: The dataset includes information on Olympic Games from 1896 to 2022, focusing on hosting countries, medal distribution, and athlete performance.

## Methodology

The analysis combines data filtering, grouping, and visualization techniques using tools like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, Plotly, and ipywidgets to create interactive plots and graphs for data exploration and presentation.

- **Hosting Analysis**: Used choropleth maps and pie charts to examine the distribution of countries and continents hosting the Olympics.
- **Medal Analysis**: Analyzed total and individual medal counts for each country using interactive choropleth maps and visualizations.
- **France's Performance**: Investigated France's Olympic performance across sports using bar plots.
- **Home Advantage**: Compared medal counts of host countries in their host year versus the previous Olympics.

## Key Findings

- **Hosting Distribution**: Europe and America have hosted the Olympics most frequently, with developed nations leading in hosting frequency.
- **Medal Distribution**: The United States and European countries consistently lead in medal counts.
- **France's Strengths**: France excels in Athletics, Fencing, and Swimming.
- **Home Advantage**: Hosting the Summer Olympics generally boosts a country's total medal count compared to previous Games.

## Limitations

- The analysis does not consider the long-term benefits or challenges host countries may face post-Olympics.
- The data may not fully capture the complexity of Olympic competition and success due to various influencing factors.

## Next Steps

- Explore France's Olympic performance over the years using line charts.
